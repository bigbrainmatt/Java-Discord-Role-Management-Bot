# Seaside Bot

**Seaside Bot** is a custom-built Discord bot inspired by the Croma5 Bot used in CaliRP.  
This bot is a personal project designed to showcase my programming skills and is not intended to expose or replicate any proprietary CaliRP information.

The bot utilizes the following libraries:

- **JDA** (*Java Discord API*) - `net.dv8tion`  
  Powers all Discord bot interactions.

  Manages environment variables for secure storage of sensitive information like API tokens.

- **Gson** - `com.google.code.gson`  
  Handles JSON operations for configuration and data storage.

- **OpenCSV** - `com.opencsv`  
  Facilitates structured handling of CSV files for user data and other records.

### Notes

This project reflects my dedication to building scalable, efficient, and self-contained bots tailored for specific use cases, while respecting privacy and ensuring secure data handling.
